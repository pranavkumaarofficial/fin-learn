CHAPTER 1: INVESTMENT LANDSCAPE 
 
 
1.1 Investors and their Financial Goals 
“Please suggest some good investments.” “Which mutual fund schemes should one buy this 
year?” “Which is the best mutual fund scheme?” “Which is the best investment?” “Should I 
invest in stocks or real estate?” “What is your view of the stock market?” “Are my investments 
proper? Or should I make some changes?” 
 
One hears these and many similar questions, very regularly. There is an issue with these 
questions. These are about the investments and not the investor. The investor’s needs are 
not even discussed, and probably not even considered important. 
 
As leadership guru and bestselling author Simon Sinek says, “Start with Why”. The discussion 
of investments must start with “why” – the purpose of investment. “Why is one investing?” 
 
1.1.1 Why Investments? 
 
Let us take a look at some examples: 
 
Shalini, an eight-year-old girl, lives in a mid-size town in North India with her parents.   She is 
highly inspired by watching the recent success of India’s space programs, in which some 
women scientists played a huge role. She wants to become a space scientist. Her parents, 
Mrs. And Mr. Gupta want to support her pursue her dream. 
 
Rabindra, 45 years old, is working as an engineer in a large multinational firm. His wife     is a 
homemaker. Since the company does not provide any pension plan, he is worried     about how 
they would be able to live a comfortable life once he retires from the job. 
 
Surinder Singh has recently moved to a large city from his hometown, as he got a promotion

and a transfer in the company where he works. While his job is very good, he is facing trouble 
in settling down with a house. He is tired of going house-hunting every now and then and is 
thinking of buying his own house in the near future. 
 
Mrs. D’Souza has recently retired from her job. She received a large sum as retirement   benefits. 
She intends to invest the same in order to receive regular income to live a comfortable life. 
 
1.1.2 Financial Goals 
 
The above are some examples of common situations we see regularly in our own life or the 
lives of people around us. Though there is no explicit mention of money in these examples, 
we intuitively know that money would be involved in each of these situations, whether Shalini 
has to be educated well, or Surinder Singh has to buy a house, or Mrs. D’Souza or Rabindra 
have to fund their lives in retirement. In the investment world, the requirements of these four 
are known as financial objectives. When we assign amounts and timelines to these objectives, 
we convert these into financial goals. 
 
There are numerous examples of such financial goals. Among the most common are funding 
a child’s education, the cost of the marriage of one’s son or daughter, funding the lifestyle in 
retirement, buying a vehicle, buying or renovating one’s house, taking a big vacation. At the 
same time, there could be some not-so-common ones like starting one’s own business or 
taking a sabbatical from work and fund one’s higher education. 
 
Goal setting is a very important exercise while planning for investments. As seen above, all 
the financial goals are about the need for money that cannot be fulfilled through the inflow at 
that time. While the expenses for the goal may be high or low, the income (from salary, 
professional fees, etc.) may be less than the amount required to fund the goal. This is where 
money needs to be withdrawn from the investments – in other words, this is why one needs 
to invest the money. 
 
The first step in goal setting is to identify these events in life. Some of these are desirable and 
can be planned, whereas some others, which may be undesirable, may spring up as surprises. 
Those events with a potential negative outcome would be undesirable. Some of the examples 
of the same are the death of a family member, hospitalization, accident, theft, fire, etc. One 
cannot plan to fund the expenses associated with such events through investments, though 
we can create an emergency fund using some savings and investment products. Apart from the 
emergency fund, one may buy insurance policies to cover the risks of such events. 
After identifying the events, one needs to assign priorities–which of these are more important 
than the others. Retirement or children’s education fall into the responsibility’s category, 
whereas a grand vacation may be a good-to-have goal. Having said that, it is only the individual 
and the family that can decide which is which. A financial advisor or a mutual fund distributor 
may only guide and help one take an appropriate decision. At the same time, the role of such 
an intermediary would be very important. 


## Page 15

15 
 
After that, one needs to assign a timeline as well as the amount of funding required at the 
time of such events. Take for example, if someone is planning to buy a house, one needs to 
decide the type of house one wants, as well as the location. These inputs would help arrive at 
approximate cost. After that one needs to decide by when one would like to buy this. Both 
the timeline and amount are critical for one to be able to plan to achieve the goal. 
 
Such an exercise allows one to classify the goals in terms of the timeline – are the goals in the 
near term, or far in the future? 
 
1.1.3 Short term needs versus Long Term Goals 
 
Take a relook at the examples at the beginning of the chapter. Shalini’s higher education is 
roughly ten years away, whereas Rabindra may work for another fifteen years. On the other 
hand, Surinder Singh may need to buy a house in the next couple of years. Mrs. D’Souza’s 
case is interesting since she has a need for income from investments in the immediate term, 
but the same must also continue for a long and uncertain period, as the income is required 
for life. Rabindra would also enter a similar situation on retirement. 
 
The retirement goal can be broken into two parts – accumulating a sum for retirement and 
then taking income out of the corpus thus accumulated. Another look at the two approaches 
to classify the goals indicates that the goals can be placed in the following matrix: 
 
 
Critically important 
(responsibilities or needs) 
Dreams 
Good-to-have 
Immediate term  
 
 
Near term 
 
 
 
Medium term 
 
 
 
Long term 
 
 
 
This looks very similar to the urgent v/s important matrix that Stephen Covey discussed in his 
bestseller “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People”. The matrix is referred to in the 
context of time management, and it classifies various tasks one undertakes during the day, as 
well as over a period. Let us take a look at the matrix: 
The Time Management Matrix 
 
Urgent 
Not Urgent 
Important 
I 
II 
Not Important 
III 
IV 
 
(Source: The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, by Stephen R Covey) 
 
In the book, Covey says that as long as you keep focusing on Quadrant I, it keeps getting bigger 


## Page 16

16 
 
and bigger and then starts to dominate you. This quadrant referred to by Covey is “urgent and 
important”. When that happens, the ‘important but not-so-urgent’ tasks are not planned for 
in time until they also enter the quadrant 1, becoming urgent. The same principle applies to 
financial goals, too. A large number of people struggle with their finances since they do not 
plan for the important and not urgent events in life. 
 
Wisdom suggests that if one plans well for those important and not urgent tasks (and goals), 
life changes for the better. In order to achieve this, it is important to first classify the financial 
goals – those events in life in terms of timeline and importance in one’s life. 
 
1.1.4 Financial Goals, Time Horizon for their achievement and Inflation 
 
The next step would be to assign amounts to the financial goals. In the process of planning, 
this is an important question: How much would it cost? Shalini, the eight-year-old, wants to 
be a space scientist, for which she needs good quality education. How much would such 
education cost? Well, this question must be answered in terms of the amount needed when 
Shalini reaches college. And that is roughly a decade from now. In such a case, the costs are 
quite likely to move up. Such a rise in the cost of the goals is called inflation. It applies to many 
other areas of personal finance. This is known as inflation with respect to the goal value. 
 
Inflation adjustment for the goal values is critical, without which the entire planning can go 
haywire. The cost of education has been going up at a very fast pace over the last few decades. 
Similar is the case of the cost of healthcare, which can have a big impact on the expenses 
during the retirement years. 
 
1.1.5 The Pool Approach 
 
Some people have a pool of savings / investment and meet their financial requirements from 
the pool. It is possible to manage that way. However, the lacuna is, you are not sure of the 
horizon for the investments. As we will see going ahead, knowing your horizon is important 
for investment decisions.  
 
Case Study: 
 
In case of Shalini’s higher education. Assume that the cost of her higher education is Rs. 50 
lacs (in today’s price), whereas Shalini would go to college 10 years later. If the inflation in 
college fees is expected to be 8 percent p.a., her parents need to provide for Rs. 1,07,94,625 
in 10 years, approximately.1 There are too many assumptions involved here–the course 
Shalini would pursue, the cost of the education, and the inflation. However, one needs to 
start with some assumptions to plan properly. Else, the parents may plan to accumulate Rs. 
50 lacs, which would be grossly insufficient. 
 
                                                 
1Note: Inflation numbers are taken based on random assumptions, and only for illustration purposes. 


## Page 17

17 
 
Inflation has a long-term impact, and hence while planning for funding all the long-term goals, 
one must consider inflation in the cost of the goal. On the other hand, the immediate term 
and near-term goals may not have a big impact due to changes in price. 
 
As mentioned earlier, inflation is the rise in prices of various products, and services consumed. 
If the inflation is 6 percent p.a., the household expenses would be higher a year later in 
comparison to today’s cost of living. If a family’s monthly expenses are Rs. 30,000 currently, 
they would be spending Rs. 31,800 next year if the inflation is 6 percent. This does not look 
like much, but if the inflation stays at the same level, this family’s monthly expenses would 
be roughly Rs. 53,725 after 10 years; and Rs. 96,214 after 20 years. 
 
There is one thing common in all these financial goals: a mismatch of cash flows. Either the 
expenses are far higher than the income at that point in time, or there is no income at the 
time of funding these goals. Since these are future goals, an investor may have time to 
accumulate one’s savings; and grow them through appropriate investment avenues. 
 
1.2 Savings or Investments? 
Before taking a look at various investment options available for an investor, some important 
questions need to be tackled. Do the two words “saving” and “investment” mean the same 
thing? Or are they different words? If these are different things, which is better – saving or 
investing? Such clarification is warranted since many individuals use the two terms 
interchangeably. 
 
The word “saving” originates from the same root as “safe”. The safety of money is of critical 
importance here. Whereas, when one invests money, the primary objective typically is to earn 
profits. The important point to note here is that there is a trade-off between risk and return. 
 
The other difference is evident from the dictionary definition of “saving”– reduction in the 
amount of money used. This definition refers to reducing consumption so that some money 
is saved. It is this saved money that can be invested. In other words, saving and investing are 
not to be considered as two completely different things, but two steps of the same process – 
in order to invest money, one needs to save first. Thus, saving precedes investing. 
 
1.2.1 Factors to evaluate investments 
 
The three most important factors to evaluate investments are safety, liquidity, and returns. 
In addition to these, there are few more parameters such as convenience, ticket size (or the 
minimum investment required), taxability of earnings, tax deduction, etc. These factors have 
been discussed below: 
 
Safety: This begins with the safety of capital invested. However, one could stretch that to also 
include the degree of surety of income from investment. In order to understand the safety of 
an investment, it is important to understand the risks involved. 


## Page 18

18 
 
Liquidity: How easily can one liquidate the investment and convert it to cash? The degree of 
ease is different across different categories, and even within the categories, the same could 
be different across products. Sometimes, the nature of the product could be such that selling 
it is difficult, whereas sometimes there could be some operational features, e.g., a lock-in for 
a certain period, after which one may be able to liquidate the investment; or a penalty for an 
early exit. While such a penalty does not hamper liquidity, it only lowers the investment 
returns. Another aspect that one may also want to look at is divisibility. Is it possible to 
liquidate part of the investment or is it necessary to sell the whole thing? 
 
Returns: As seen earlier in the definition of investments, the major purpose is to get some 
returns from investment. Such returns may be in the form of regular (or periodic) income, 
also known as current income; and capital appreciation, or capital gains. 
 
The current income is receivable periodically, without having to sell the investment, whereas 
the capital gains can be realized only when one sells the investment. 
 
The exit charges or penalty would bring down the returns, as seen earlier. Hence, whenever 
there are any such charges for withdrawals (including early withdrawals), the same must be 
considered as a trade-off between liquidity and returns. 
 
Convenience: Any investment must be evaluated in terms of convenience with respect to 
investing, taking the money out–fully or partially, as well as the investor’s ability to 
conveniently check the value of the investment, as well as to receive the income. 
 
Ticket size: What is the minimum amount required for investment? There are some avenues 
where an investor can start investing amounts as small as Rs. 50 or Rs. 100, whereas some 
require more than Rs. 1 lakh, and sometimes more than Rs. 1 crore. This becomes an 
important factor while taking a decision about the selection of investment options. At the 
same time, this must not be the only factor. Some investors (though a very small number) 
have started considering certain investments (requiring large amounts), only because they 
could afford the same, without checking whether they needed it, or if that was appropriate for 
their situation and goals. 
 
Taxability of income: What one retains after taxes is what matters, and hence, taxation of 
the earnings is another important factor that one must consider. While looking at the 
taxability of income, it is critical to evaluate various other factors, too, and not look at taxation 
in isolation. For example, some products may offer lower tax on investment returns, but the 
safety also may be low. At the same time, there could be some products that may offer low 
tax on investment returns, only if the investor stays invested for a certain term, or till the 
maturity of the product. In other words, if the investor sells the investment before maturity 
(or a certain minimum period), the investment returns may be taxable. 
 
Tax deduction: A related matter is the tax deduction that may be available in case of certain 
products. Such a deduction effectively increases the return on investment, since the same is 


## Page 19

19 
 
calculated after factoring the net amount invested. 
 
However, where a deduction is available, the product may have a lock-in period of certain 
years. Once again, this is a trade-off between liquidity and tax deduction. 
 
The above discussion offers a good framework for the evaluation of investment products. 
However, as mentioned earlier, no factor should be seen in isolation. One also must consider 
the investor’s situation while evaluating the avenues. 
 
1.3 Different Asset Classes 
Various investment avenues can be grouped in various categories, called asset classes. An 
asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics. There are four 
broad asset categories or asset classes, and then there are various subcategories, within each 
of these. The four broad categories—Real estate, Commodities, Equity and Fixed income. 
 
1.3.1 Real Estate 
 
Real estate is considered as the most important and popular among all the asset classes. 
However, the popularity of this asset category is large because of a reason not related to 
investment. For those who have bought their own houses, it is the largest expense in life. The 
word used here is “expense”, and not “investment”. This would be elaborated later, but it is 
pertinent to mention here that in majority of cases, individuals purchase real estate for self- 
occupation. This should not be considered as an investment, since selling the same may have 
a negative impact on one’s lifestyle. 
 
Real estate could be further classified into various categories, viz., residential real estate, land, 
commercial real estate, etc. 
 
As an asset category, real estate exhibits certain traits, some of which are listed as under: 
 
• Location is the most important factor impacting the performance of an investment in 
real estate 
• Real estate is illiquid 
• It is not a divisible asset 
• One can invest in physical real estate, as well as in the financial form 
• Apart from capital appreciation, it can also generate current income in form of rents 
• In case of real estate, the transaction costs, e.g., brokerage charges, registration charges, 
etc. are quite high. This would bring down the return on investment. 
• The cost of maintenance of the property, as well as any taxes payable must be adjusted 
before calculating the return on investment, something that many individual investors 
do not. These expenses are also quite high, and cannot be ignored. 
• The investments acquired or sold shall be accounted at transaction price excluding all 
transaction costs such as brokerage, stamp charges and any charge customarily included 
in the broker’s contract note that are attributable to acquisition/sale of investments. 


## Page 20

1.3.2 Commodities 
 
This is another asset category that people at large are familiar with in various ways. On a 
regular basis, people consume many commodities, e.g., agricultural commodities like spices; 
petroleum products such as petrol and diesel; or metals like gold and silver. However, it is not 
possible to invest in most of these, as many of these are either perishable and hence cannot 
be stored for long, or storage of the same could take a lot of space, creating a different kind 
of difficulties. 
 
Though there are commodities derivatives available on many commodities, it may not be wise 
to call these “investments” for two reasons, (1) these are leveraged contracts, i.e., one can 
take large exposure with a small of money making it highly risky and (2) these are normally 
short-term contracts, whereas the investors’ needs may be for longer periods. 
 
On the other hand, there are at least two commodities that many investors are quite familiar 
with as investment avenues, viz., gold, and silver. 
 
When someone invests in these commodities, the prices are almost in sync across the world. 
It is easy to understand the prices of gold and silver across countries by simply looking at the 
foreign exchange rate between the two countries’ currencies, and making adjustments for 
various costs and restrictions imposed by any of the countries. In this manner, these two are 
globally accepted assets. 
 
Both these commodities have been used as investments or storage of value for long. In fact, 
the history of currency would be incomplete without mention of these two. Gold has also 
been considered by many as a safe haven asset. In case of failure of an economy, or a 
currency, gold is considered to be the final shelter. However, the opposite camp also comes 
with very strong arguments. Many currencies across the world were pegged to the gold 
reserves available with the central bank of the country for long. However, this so-called gold 
standard has been done away with a few decades ago. And still, most of the central banks hold 
gold in their reserves. 
 
An investor in these commodities would have to count only on capital appreciation since 
these do not generate any current income. 
 
Gold and silver come in varying degrees of purity. Each one can be bought at different prices 
from the market. However, for a large majority of investors, it is almost impossible to make 
out the level of purity. If we opt for a purity certificate, the cost goes up and without one, the 
risk of getting lower quality metal is high. 
 
1.3.3 Fixed Income 
 
When someone borrows money, one has to return the principal borrowed to the lender in 
the future. There could also be some interest payable on the amount borrowed. There are 


## Page 21

21 
 
various forms of borrowing, some of which are through marketable instruments like bonds 
and debentures2. 
 
There are many issuers of such papers, e.g., Companies, Union Government, State 
Governments, Municipal Corporations, banks, financial institutions, public sector enterprises, 
etc. 
 
Many bonds pay regular interest; thus, the investors can expect current income. At the same 
time, if someone has invested at the time of issuance of the bond and hold the same till 
maturity, in almost all cases, there would be no capital gains. On the other hand, a transaction 
through secondary market – whether at the time of buying or at the time of selling, or both – 
may result into capital gains or losses. 
 
Bonds are generally considered to be safer than equity. However, these are not totally free 
from risks. These risks will be discussed in detail later in the chapter. 
 
Bonds can be classified into subcategories on the basis of issuer type i.e., issued by the 
government or corporates or on the basis of the maturity date: short term bonds (ideal for 
liquidity needs), medium term bonds, and long-term bonds (income generation needs). 
 
1.3.4 Equity 
 
This is the owner’s capital in a business. Someone who buys shares in a company becomes a 
part-owner in the business. In that sense, this is risk capital, since the owner’s earnings from 
the business are linked to the fortunes, and hence the risks, of the business. When one buys 
the shares of a company through the secondary market, the share price could be high or low 
in comparison to the fair price. 
 
Historically, equity investing has generated returns in excess of inflation, which means the 
purchasing power of one’s money has increased over the years. It has also delivered higher 
returns than other investment avenues, most of the time, if one considers long investment 
periods. Since the base year of 1979, Sensex has grown from a level of 100 to around 66000 
i.e., July 2023. This is an appreciation of around 16 percent p.a., compounded annually.3 
 
Apart from long term capital appreciation, equity share owners may also receive dividends 
from the company. Such dividends are shared out of the profit that the company has 
generated from its business operations. If the company does really well, the dividends tend 
to grow over the years. 
 
To sum up, equity share prices generally fluctuate a lot, often without regard to the business 
fundamentals. However, over long periods of time, the share prices follow the fortunes of the 
                                                 
2We would use the two words bonds and debentures interchangeably in this discussion. 
3Sensex is BSE’s benchmark index representing shares of 30 large-sized companies. It is also considered to be one of the 
bellwether indices, a barometer of what is happening in the stock market in India. 


## Page 22

22 
 
firm. If the profits of the company continue to grow over the years, the share price follows. 
 
There are similarities and differences between the various asset categories. 
 
Investments in equity and bonds can be done only in financial form, whereas one can buy the 
other two assets, viz., real estate and commodities either in financial or in physical form. It is 
this physical form that gives a feeling of safety to many. Anything that is tangible is perceived 
to be safer than something intangible. 
 
Real estate and commodities differ from equity and bonds in another way, too. These could 
be bought as an investment or for consumption purposes. For example, one may invest in 
residential property and give it on rent to generate income. This is an investment. At the same 
time, one may also buy a flat to live in–for residential purposes. Such a self-occupied house 
may not be an investment. A similar logic may be applied to gold and silver by checking 
whether one has invested in the metal or bought the same for personal use. 
 
When someone invests in equity shares, part of the profits made by the company may be 
shared with the investor. With a careful analysis of various equity shares, it is possible to 
receive a periodic income (though without any guarantee about how much would one 
receive, and whether one receives anything at all). Similarly, real estate could be given on 
rent to generate intermittent cash flow. Bonds pay interest income. It is the commodities 
where such intermittent cash flow is not generated. 
 
An investor in equity, real estate and commodities is an owner of the asset, whereas an 
investor in bonds has lent money to someone. In such a case, the lender’s receipts—be its 
interest payments or return of principal amount invested – are agreed at the time of the issue 
of such instruments. In all the other three cases, the investor’s cash flows (or receipts) are 
unknown. To that extent, the future returns from these assets, which may also be called 
ownership assets, would be highly uncertain in comparison to the lending assets like bonds 
or fixed deposits. 
 
While the above discussion was about the characteristics of various asset classes and certain 
differences across the asset categories, the same must be seen from another perspective, too. 
While one may buy equity shares listed in India in Indian Rupees, one can also invest in shares 
of various companies listed outside India. This provides exposure to another currency. For 
example, an investor buying the shares of a company listed on the London Stock Exchange is 
exposed to the fortunes of the company, as well as the change in the exchange rate between 
the British Pound and the Indian Rupee. 
 
Similarly, one could also invest in bonds denominated in various currencies other than Indian 
Rupee, and one could also buy real estate abroad. These are called international assets. 
However, one must understand the basic nature of the asset class as discussed earlier, and 
then try to assess the impact of currency fluctuation on these investments.

1.4 Investment Risks 
To obtain a better understanding of the investment avenues, it is essential to understand the 
different types of risks involved. 
 
1.4.1 Inflation Risk 
 
Inflation or price inflation is the general rise in the prices of various commodities, products, 
and services that we consume. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. The following 
table explains what inflation can do to the purchasing power of our money. 
 
How much money would you need to buy the goods you can 
buy with Rs. 10,000 today 
If inflation is assumed 
at 8% p.a.4 
After 5 years 
Rs. 14,693 
                                                 
4 The numbers are arrived at by using the future value equation, i.e., A = P * (1 + r) ^ n, where A is the future value (the values 
in the right-side column); P is the present value (Rs. 10,000 in the example); r is the rate of inflation (8% p.a. in the example); 
n is the number of years (the periods in the first column in this table). 


## Page 24

24 
 
After 10 years 
Rs. 21,589 
After 20 years 
Rs. 46,610 
After 30 years 
Rs. 1,00,627 
The above table shows how fast the purchasing power of the money goes down. This risk hits 
hard over long periods. If this is not properly accounted for in the investment plan, one may 
fall short of the target when the need arises. 
 
One may also look at the impact of inflation in another way. If one could buy 100 units of 
something with Rs. 10,000 today, assuming inflation of 8 percent p.a., one would be able to 
buy only 68 units of the same thing after 5 years, and only 46 units after 10 years. This clearly 
shows the loss of purchasing power. 
 
In this context, it is pertinent to take a look at whether the investments are able to protect 
purchasing power or not. In order to protect the purchasing power, the investment return 
should be at least as much as inflation. If the same is higher than inflation, the purchasing 
power increases, whereas if one earns lower returns than inflation, the purchasing power 
drops. 
 
Incidentally, when one seeks the total safety of invested capital, along with anytime liquidity, 
the investment returns are usually lower than inflation. Take for example, if you earn an 
interest rate of 7 per cent p.a. on your fixed deposit when the inflation is at 8 per cent p.a., it is 
obvious that the investment grows at a slower pace than the rise in prices. The returns on 
investment without factoring inflation is known as the “nominal rate”. However, when this 
number is adjusted for inflation, one gets the “real rate of return”. If the investment returns are 
higher than inflation, the investor is earning a positive real rate, and vice versa. 
 
1.4.2 Liquidity Risk 
 
Investments in fixed income assets are usually considered less risky than equity. Even within 
that, government securities are considered the safest. In order to avail the full benefits of the 
investments, or to earn the promised returns, there is a condition attached. The investment 
must be held till maturity. In case if one needs liquidity, there could be some charges or such 
an option may not be available at all. 
 
Here is an example. Assume that an investor has invested one’s money in a safe investment 
option, a bank deposit for a goal that is due five years from now. For such a goal, one chose 
to invest in a five-year fixed deposit. As is clear, the term of the deposit is five years, and the 
promised returns would accrue to the investor only if the money is kept in the deposit for the 
entire period. In case, for some reason the investor needs the money before maturity, there 
could be some deduction in the interest, which reduces the investment return. Some other 
products like PPF (Public Provident Fund) may offer no liquidity for a certain period, and even 
after that, there may be only partial liquidity. 
This risk is also very closely associated with real estate, where liquidity is very low, and often 


## Page 25

25 
 
it takes weeks or months to sell the investment. 
 
Some investment options offer instant access to funds, but the value of the investment may 
be subject to fluctuations. Equity shares, listed on stock exchanges are an example of this. 
While it is easy to sell shares to get cash in case of a large number of listed shares, the equity 
prices go up and down periodically. Such investments are not appropriate for funding short 
term liquidity needs. 
 
1.4.3 Credit Risk 
 
When someone lends money to a borrower, the borrower commits to repay the principal as 
well as pay the interest as per the agreed schedule. The same applies in the case of a 
debenture or a bond or a fixed deposit. In the case of these instruments, the issuer of the 
instruments is the borrower, whereas the investor is the lender. The issuer agrees to pay the 
interest and repay the principal as per an agreed schedule. There are three possibilities in 
such arrangements: 
 
(1) the issuer honours all commitments in time, (2) the issuer pays the dues, but with some 
delay, and (3) the issuer does not pay principal and the interest at all. While the first is the 
desirable situation, the latter two are not. Credit risk is all about the possibility that the second 
or the third situation may arise. 
 
Any delay or default in the repayment of principal or payment of interest may arise due to a 
problem with one or both of the two reasons: (1) the ability of the borrower, or (2) the 
intention of the borrower. While the ability of the borrower, if the same happens to be a 
company, is a function of the business stability and profitability of the company. Stable 
companies, which may be market leaders in their respective segments, may pose a lower risk, 
in comparison to a new company, or a small-sized company in the same industry. Some 
industries may also exhibit higher stability in comparison to some other. 
 
A lender tries to assess both before lending the money or expects enough compensation in 
case the ability appears to be low. In the case of debentures or bonds, the investor would 
expect higher interest from bonds with low safety. 
 
In this context, the bonds issued by the government of their own country would be considered 
to be the safest for investors. Such bonds normally offer the lowest interest rates for the 
citizens of the country, due to the high (highest) safety of capital. All the other bonds/ 
debentures available in the country would offer a higher rate of interest. 
 
1.4.4 Market Risk and Price Risk 
 
When securities are traded in an open market, people can buy or sell the same based on their 
opinions. It does not matter whether these opinions are based on facts, or otherwise. Since 
the opinions may change very fast, the prices may fluctuate more in comparison to the change 


## Page 26

26 
 
in facts related to security. Such fluctuations are also referred to as volatility. 
 
There are two types of risks to a security—market risk and price risk. 
 
Let us understand this through an example. When there is a possibility of a country getting 
into a warlike situation, there is a widespread fear that this may impact the economy and the 
companies within it. Due to such a fear, it is quite possible that the prices of all stocks (or at 
least a large number of stocks) in the market may witness a fall. This is a market-wide fall. On 
the other hand, when the sales of a company’s products fall, due to technological changes, or 
the arrival of a better product, the company’s share price falls. During such times, there could 
be many other companies, whose share prices may rise. This is an example of a company 
specific risk. As is evident from the discussion, the stability of the company’s business and the 
profitability of the firm play a major role with respect to company specific risk factors. 
Between the general, market-wide factors and firm-specific factors, there could be some 
industry-specific factors, which would impact all the firms within the same industry. For 
example, if the Government policy changes with respect to a particular industry, all the firms 
may get impacted. Similarly, if a new and better technology becomes available, all the firms 
within the same industry that use the old technology may get impacted. This happened when 
mobile phones started becoming popular, the pager industry vanished in less than a couple 
of decades. 
 
The risk specific to the security can be reduced through diversification across unrelated 
securities, but the one that is market-wide cannot be reduced through diversification. 
 
1.4.5 Interest Rate Risk 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment's value will change as a result of a change in 
interest rates. This risk affects the value of bonds/debt instruments more directly than stocks. 
Any reduction in interest rates will increase the value of the instrument and vice versa. 
While most investors are familiar with the concept of debentures, they normally buy and hold 
these bonds till maturity. On maturity of the bond, they get the maturity amount, since it is 
part of the bond agreement (assuming the company does not default on the commitment). 
 
On the other hand, if an investor sells the bond in the secondary market, one would have to 
do the transaction at the current market price. This price depends on many factors, but chief 
among these is the change in the interest rates in the economy. The relationship between 
interest rates and bond prices is inverse. 
 
When the interest rates in the economy increase, the prices of existing bonds decrease, since 
they continue to offer the old interest rates. Assume that a bond was issued at Rs. 1000 for one 
year, and it offered an interest rate of 8 percent. Immediately after the bond was issued, the 
interest rates in the economy increased, and new bonds are now offering 8.5 percent interest. 
In such a case, the earlier bond becomes less attractive. If the investor who invested in that 


## Page 27

27 
 
bond wants to sell, it can only be done at a discount. The reverse is also true. If in the above 
example, had the interest rate moved down, the price of the bond would have moved up. The 
interest rate risk varies for bonds with different maturities. Those with longer maturity would 
witness higher price fluctuations in comparison to those with shorter maturities. Such 
movements in bond prices on account of changes in interest are referred to as “interest rate 
risk”. This is a market-wide factor affecting the prices of all bonds. 
 
1.5 Risk Measures and Management Strategies 
Many of the risks cannot be eliminated, and the investor must take some of those, in order 
to earn decent returns on one’s investment portfolio. However, one needs to manage the 
risks that one is taking. One may consider the following strategies for management of the 
investment risks: 
 
• Avoid 
One may avoid certain investment products if one does not want to take the respective risk. 
However, this may also mean giving up the opportunity to benefit out of the said investment. 
Many experts recommend that one should avoid the investment avenues that one does not 
understand. 
 
• Take a position to benefit from some event/development 
An investor can also take an investment position in anticipation of some developments in the 
market. Let us take an example here: a bond investor expects the interest rates to go down. 
In such a case, one may sell the short maturity bonds and invest in long maturity bonds. If the 
interest rates move down, the investor’s judgment would be rewarded handsomely. At the 
same time, if the judgment is wrong, there could be losses, too. This is an example of 
managing the interest rate risk. 
Similarly, some investors manage their investment portfolios using such strategies across 
multiple asset categories. 
In order to take and dynamically change such positions, the investor must have superior 
knowledge than a large number of investors in the market. This is difficult and hence risky. 
Due to the amount of skill required, and the risks involved, such strategies are not 
recommended for a large number of investors. 
 
• Diversify 
While the previous strategy is possible when one has superior knowledge, not everyone 
would possess the same. For a lay investor a prudent approach would be to diversify across 
various investment options. This spreads the risk of loss and thus the probability of losing 
everything can be significantly reduced through diversification. 
 
Before managing the risks, the risks have to be measured. Measurement of credit risk is 
undertaken through credit rating and credit spreads. Risks related to volatility in prices, 


## Page 28

28 
 
primarily the fluctuations that happen in investment returns are measured through variance, 
standard deviation, beta, modified duration which will be discussed in Chapter 10. 
 
1.6 Behavioural Biases in Investment Decision Making 
Before discussing asset allocation, it is important to take a detour and discuss behavioural 
biases in investment decision making. This is also one of the risks the investors must 
understand. However, this risk is not related to the investments, but the role of emotions in 
decision making, or in other words the irrational behaviour of investors towards management 
of money. 
 
Investors are driven by emotions and biases. The most dominant emotions are fear, greed 
and hope. Some important biases are discussed below: 
 
• Availability Heuristic 
Most people rely on examples or experiences that come to mind immediately while analyzing 
any data, information, or options to choose from. In the investing world, this means that 
enough research is not undertaken for evaluating investment options. This leads to missing 
out on critical information, especially pertaining to various investment risks. 
 
• Confirmation Bias 
Investors also suffer from confirmation bias. This is the tendency to look for additional 
information that confirms their already held beliefs or views. It also means interpreting new 
information to confirm the views. In other words, investors decide first and then look for data 
to support their views. The downside is very similar to the previous one – investors tend to 
miss out on many risks. 
 
• Familiarity Bias 
An individual tends to prefer the familiar over the novel, as the popular proverb goes, “A 
known devil is better than an unknown angel.” This leads an investor to concentrate the 
investments in what is familiar, which at times prevents one from exploring better 
opportunities, as well as from a meaningful diversification. 
 
• Herd Mentality 
“Man is a social animal” – Human beings love to be part of a group. While this behaviour has 
helped our ancestors survive in hostile situations and against powerful animals, this often 
works against investors interests in the financial markets. There are numerous examples, 
where simply being against the herd has been the most profitable strategy. 
 
• Loss Aversion 
Loss aversion explains people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent 
gains: it is better not to lose Rs. 5,000 than to gain Rs. 5,000. Such behaviour often leads 
people to stay away from profitable opportunities, due to the perception of high risks, even 
when the risk could be very low. This was first identified by Psychologists Daniel Kahneman 


## Page 29

29 
 
and Amos Tversky. Kahneman went on to win Nobel Prize in Economics, later on. 
 
• Overconfidence 
This bias refers to a person’s overconfidence in one’s abilities or judgment. This leads one to 
believe that one is far better than others at something, whereas the reality may be quite 
different. Under the spell of such a bias, one tends to lower the guards and take on risks 
without proper assessment. 
 
• Recency bias 
The impact of recent events on decision making can be very strong. This applies equally to 
positive and negative experiences. Investors tend to extrapolate the event into the future and 
expect a repeat. A bear market or a financial crisis leads people to prefer safe assets. Similarly, 
a bull market makes people allocate more than what is advised for risky assets. The recent 
experience overrides analysis in decision making. For example, a rise in prices of equities will 
make people think only about a further rise which would lead to more investment being made 
in equities. This increases the risk. On the other hand, a fall in prices in an asset would make 
people stay away thinking it would fall further which could lead to loss of opportunities. 
 
• Behaviour patterns 
There are different types of people and the factors that influence their lives also impact the 
manner in which they save or invest. The drive to save more or be regular in investing often 
come from these personal factors. Behavioural tests are very useful in determining and 
knowing the kind of personality a person has and this would include whether they are 
spenders or savers or investors. Knowing this can help in making the right efforts to get the 
individual to perform the desired ac-on. 
 
• Interest of the investors 
Many times, the financial and investment decisions are not guided by the fact as to whether 
this investment is suitable for a person or not but by the interest of the investor. This can lead 
to the construction of portfolios which are not suitable for specific people. For example, 
someone working in the Information Technology industry might just have technology stocks 
in their portfolio. This leads to a concentration of risk and is something that has to be avoided. 
 
• Ethical standards and boundaries 
The presence of ethical principles in the dealing of individuals also has an impact as far as 
their investment behaviour is concerned. Those following ethical standards are more likely to 
pay attention to their investments and be disciplined because they tend to follow the norms. 
This is a big help when it comes to building long term wealth. Trying to take shortcuts might 
derail the entire investment process and set back the existing efforts. 
 
These are only some of the biases. This is not an exhaustive list. The negative effect of these 
biases is that the investor does not gather enough information to be able to identify more 


## Page 30

30 
 
opportunities or to evaluate various risks related to investment avenues. It is only prudent 
for an investor to do a detailed analysis as is possible, without taking such shortcuts. 
 
It is important to avoid behavioral biases in investment decisions. To detach emotions from 
investments, it is better to take the opinion of a third person i.e. Registered Investment 
Advisor (RIA) or Mutual Fund Distributor (MFD). 
 
1.7 Risk Profiling 
The risk profilers try to ascertain the risk appetite of the investor so that one does not sell 
mutual fund schemes that carry a higher risk than what the investor can handle. In order to 
ascertain the risk appetite, the following must be evaluated: 
 
• The need to take risks 
• The ability to take risks, and 
• The willingness to take risks 
 
Out of the above, the need to take risks arises when the investor needs higher returns to 
reach one’s goals. The ability to take risk refers to the financial ability, and the investment 
horizon, whereas the willingness is linked to the psychological capacity to handle risk. The 
distributor has to evaluate these three, and strike a balance between them, whenever there 
is a conflict. 
 
There are various approaches to creating the risk profile of the investor. The distributor is free 
to choose from these options. Alternately, one can also design one’s own method or tools for 
the same, based on the brief discussion mentioned above. 
 
1.8 Understanding Asset Allocation 
The basic meaning of asset allocation is to allocate an investor’s money across asset 
categories in order to achieve some objective. In reality, most investors’ portfolios would 
have the money allocated across various asset categories. However, in many such cases, the 
same may be done without any process or rationale behind it. 
Asset Allocation is a process of allocating money across various asset categories in line with a 
stated objective. The underlined words are very important. First, it is a “process”, which 
always involves several steps, and those steps should not be ignored or skipped. Second, the 
whole idea behind asset allocation is to achieve some objective. Whichever approach one 
selects, one must go through the steps of the process in order to achieve the objective. 
There are two popular approaches to asset allocation5. 
 
 
                                                 
5Note: In order to keep the discussion simple, and to understand the concept of asset allocation well, we will use a two- asset 
portfolio, consisting equity and debt, as example in the discussion under this topic. 


## Page 31

31 
 
Strategic asset allocation 
 
Strategic Asset Allocation is allocation aligned to the financial goals of the individual. It 
considers the returns required from the portfolio to achieve the goals, given the time horizon 
available for the corpus to be created and the risk profile of the individual. 
 
In other words, it is an approach to maintain a target allocation across various asset 
categories. Such a target asset allocation across the asset categories is decided based on the 
analysis of the needs and risk appetite of the investor. Such an analysis would help a mutual 
fund distributor to arrive at allocation between various asset categories in percentage terms. 
This percentage target is also called the “strategic asset allocation”. 
 
Tactical asset allocation 
 
As opposed to the strategic asset allocation, one may choose to dynamically change the 
allocation between the asset categories. The purpose of such an approach may be to take 
advantage of the opportunities presented by various markets at different points in time, but 
the primary reason for doing so is to improve the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio. In other 
words, the attempt is to either reduce the portfolio risk without compromising the returns or 
to enhance portfolio returns without increasing the risk. Tactical asset allocation is also 
referred to as dynamic asset allocation. Tactical asset allocation is typically suitable for 
seasoned investors operating with a large investible surplus. 
 
As an illustration, if the appropriate allocation to equity and debt in a portfolio is say 60:40 
and equity valuations are attractive, it may be increased to say 65:35 or 70:30. If equity 
valuation is stretched, it may be reduced somewhat. 
 
Rebalancing 
 
An investor may select any of the asset allocation approaches, however, there may be a need 
to make modifications in the asset allocations. 
 
Let us first start with the strategic allocation. In that case, the asset allocation is likely to 
change periodically, since the different assets may not move together in the same direction 
and may not move equally, even when the direction is the same. In such a case, it is quite 
possible that the current asset allocation may be different from the target allocation. What 
should one do in such a scenario? 
 
Well, many practitioners advocate that the portfolio should be rebalanced to restore the 
target asset allocation. Their argument is that the asset allocation was decided by an analysis 
of the needs and risk appetite of the investor. We need to reduce the allocation to the risky 
asset if that has gone up. On the other hand, if the allocation has gone down in the asset that 
has the potential to generate higher returns, we need to correct that as well. 


## Page 32

32 
 
Such a rebalancing offers a huge benefit – it makes the investor buy low and sell high. Let us 
understand this through an example: 
 
Assume that the target asset allocation for an investor is 50:50 between asset categories A 
and B. A year later, asset category A went up by 20 percent, whereas asset B went down by 5 
percent. In such a case, the allocation has deviated from the target. If we started investment 
of Rs. 1,000 each in both the cases, the value in both the cases would stand at Rs. 1,200 in 
asset A and Rs. 950 in asset B, with the total portfolio value at Rs. 2,150. The current allocation 
stands at 55.81 percent in asset A and 44.19 percent in asset B. This needs to be restored to 
50:50. That means selling some part of the investment in asset A (worth Rs. 125) and buying 
some in asset B. 
 
As we can see here the asset A, which has gone up, is sold; and asset B, which has gone down, 
is bought. This happens automatically, without the investor having to take a view on the 
direction of the markets. 
 
The rebalancing approach can work very well over the years when the various asset categories 
go through many market cycles of ups and downs. 
 
On the other hand, one may also need to do a rebalancing of the asset allocation, when the 
investor’s situation changes and thus the needs or the risk appetite might have changed. 
Rebalancing is required in the case of strategic asset allocation as well as tactical asset 
allocation. 
 
With the purpose to ensure uniformity across mutual funds, SEBI has provided the timelines 
for rebalancing of schemes. In the event of deviation from mandated asset allocation 
mentioned in the Scheme Information Document (SID) due to passive breaches (occurrence 
of instances not arising out of omission and commission of AMCs), mandated rebalancing 
period for all schemes other than Index Funds and Exchange Traded Funds is 30 business days. 
However, the mandated rebalancing period is not applicable to the Overnight Funds. 
 
1.9 Do-it-yourself versus Taking Professional Help 
 
As discussed earlier, investors need to invest money from time to time. These investments 
can be made in various financial instruments ranging from Government sponsored schemes 
to bank fixed deposits to company debentures to shares of companies or real estate 
properties of even precious metals like gold or silver. 
 
One option is to manage the investments oneself. That would involve finding the right 
investments and carrying out the related research and administration work. The other option 
is to outsource the entire job to a professional or a company engaged in such a business. 
 
A mutual fund is that second option – it is managed by a team of professionals, known as the 


## Page 33

33 
 
asset management company. This is what really needs to be understood. By choosing to 
invest through mutual funds, one is not investing in alternative investment options, but only 
changing the way of investing money. The entire job of investing is outsourced to a 
professional firm. 
 
So, the next logical question is: “Which of the two choices is better – investing oneself or 
taking professional help to manage my investments?” 
 
This question should be broken down into three components: 
 
1. Can one do the job oneself? 
2. Does one want to do it? 
3. Can one afford to outsource? 
 
Can one do the job oneself? 
 
This is the question about ability. In order to do a good job, there are a few requirements, 
viz., ability to do the job and the availability of time required for the same. There are tasks 
where one may not have the skills and knowledge, e.g., a history teacher may not be able to 
help her daughter to study Mathematics in the higher classes. At the same time, one may not 
have enough time required for the job. 
 
In either case, one is unable to do manage money oneself and should consider outsourcing it. 
 
Does one want to do it? 
 
Even when one has the required skills and knowledge to manage one’s money, it is very likely 
that one may not enjoy money management–either the research and analysis or 
administration or accounting. At the same time, one may want to spend time on one’s main 
profession or on certain other activities, e.g., spending time with family and friends, pursuing 
hobbies, etc. That also means that one needs help in managing investments. 
 
Can one afford to outsource? 
 
There is some cost associated with mutual funds since the agencies involved need to be paid 
their professional fees. While we will cover the costs associated with managing mutual funds 
in a later chapter, it is important to mention here that SEBI (the securities markets regulator) 
has issued guidelines on the maximum amount that can be charged to the fund.  
 
Most people make the mistake of comparing these fees with zero cost of managing one’s own 
money oneself. By this comparison, the cost of a mutual fund always looks higher between 
the two options. 
 
What is missed out in this comparison is the hidden costs of doing the investment 


## Page 34

34 
 
management job on one’s own. This hidden cost comes in the form of one’s time and the 
potential mistakes that an individual investor is likely to make. 
 
First, let us look at the cost of one’s time. Let us assume that a person generates the same 
investment returns as what a fund manager would have generated before the costs. Let us 
also assume that the cost of fund management is 2 percent p.a. This means if one is able to 
generate 12 percent p.a. by investing oneself, the mutual fund scheme would return 10 
percent p.a. net of the fund management charges. On a portfolio of Rs. 10 lakhs, this amounts 
to a saving of roughly Rs. 20,000 for the year. Is it worth spending the amount of time one is 
required to spend for this saving? Please consider the amount of research one has to put in 
as well as the administration and accounting work. Someone may start thinking that this 
means investors with smaller portfolios should invest through mutual funds, but the bigger 
ones should not. This is where the concept of the value of time should be looked at. The value 
of time may be higher in the case of people with more wealth. 
 
The second hidden cost comes in the form of the mistakes one is likely to make given the 
emotional attachment with one’s own finances. 
 
For most investors, a mutual fund would turn out to be a better option than to build the 
portfolio oneself. The next chapter discusses what mutual funds are and their role in an 
investor’s portfolio.
