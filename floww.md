ðŸ“Š Complete Learning Loop:

Immediate Feedback â†’ Shows why wrong + concepts to review
Section References â†’ Direct user to specific pages
Adaptive Questions â†’ Next level focuses on weak areas
Comprehensive Analysis â†’ End-of-level insights
Targeted Practice â†’ Future questions reinforce gaps

This creates a personalized learning experience where:

Students learn from mistakes immediately
They know exactly where to study more
The system adapts to their needs
Weak areas get more practice
Strong areas are maintained but not over-practiced
